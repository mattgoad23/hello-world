# hello-world
A description of what? I'm new at this.

Oh, okay. A little about myself.

Well, I'm 20 years old, and I tried learning code once with Codecademy and got frustrated, tried it again about 6 months later and for some reason, had a lot of fun learning it that time.

Now, I am trying to learn some programming languages and hoping to become a developer one day.
