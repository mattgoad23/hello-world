# hello-world
A description of what? I'm new at this.

Oh, okay. A little about myself.

Well, I am 20 years old and just recently started learning to code with Codecademy. I tried it a few months ago for the first time but got frustrated so I gave it up, then tried it again after a few months and for some reason actually had fun doing it.

Now I am trying to learn some programming languages to develop my skills.
